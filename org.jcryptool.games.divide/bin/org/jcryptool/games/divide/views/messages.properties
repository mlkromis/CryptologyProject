DivideView_19=Divider Game (according to C. Licht)
DivideView_20=This is a kind of Nim game. To start the game, please define an "Initial number" and click on "Start the game". Then within the game area all dividers of the initial number will be shown. The default initial number is 2520 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 which has 48 dividers.\nAdditionally you will be asked who should start. You opponent is either the computer or another person (see Game type).\nSubsequently, the players alternately choose one of the shown blue dividers. The selected divider and all its multiples will be grayed out and cannot be chosen anymore.\nThe player who chooses or is forced to choose the number 1 loses. So your goal is not to take the last number.
