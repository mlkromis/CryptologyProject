KeyViewer_cryptoversion=Version for cryptographic use - e.g. deciphering a text, ...
KeyViewer_invertback=Invert the key back (to the initial state)
KeyViewer_invertdescription=Invert the Key (The inverted key is the exact opposite of original key. Encrypting a text with a key, and then with the inverse key, will result in the original text.)
KeyViewer_invertone=Invert
KeyViewer_prettyversion="Pretty version" - for copying into text, etc.
ReadDirectionChooser_0=column-wise
ReadDirectionChooser_1=row-wise
TranspAnalysisUI_Export=Export
TranspAnalysisUI_Results=Results
TranspAnalysisUI_btnCheckButton_text=Apply the selected text transformation (%s)
TranspAnalysisUI_btnOpenTextWizard_text=Load text
TranspAnalysisUI_decipher=Write displayed preview text into a new editor
TranspAnalysisUI_grpEditText=Edit the loaded text (set number of columns, column reordering)
TranspAnalysisUI_keyfound=Key (corresponds to column order)\:
TranspAnalysisUI_keypreview_zerocolumns=[Can only be determined with a number of columns > 0]
TranspAnalysisUI_keyviewer=Key viewer
TranspAnalysisUI_lblChooseAnotherText=<a>(choose another text)</a>
TranspAnalysisUI_lblColumnCount_text_1=number of columns\: 
TranspAnalysisUI_lblHoweverTheColumn_text=First, you have to determine the number of columns of the table. To find the correct combination (number of columns and the column reordering) its recommended to look at the first line only. If the following lines won't look right, start over with another number of columns.
TranspAnalysisUI_lblLoadedTextwith_text=Loaded text (with reorderable colums)\:
TranspAnalysisUI_lblNewLabel_1_text=Parameters of the cipher\: 
TranspAnalysisUI_lblTheseTextSettings_text=These text settings indicate that a columnwise read-in or read-out has been performed at encryption, whilst not filling up the last row of the transposition table with placeholders. If this is the case, you MAY not be able to decipher the text with this plugin.\nChoose other settings if you are not certain that these are the right ones.
TranspAnalysisUI_lblTryToRecover_text=Try to recover the plain text by reordering the columns of the table, such that the transposition of the text is reversed.
TranspAnalysisUI_lblYouHaveSelected_text=Your selected input\:
TranspAnalysisUI_lbl_params_mask=\n- read-in-direction of text into the transposition table\: %s\n- read-out-direction of the text in the transposition table\: %s\n- Alphabet\: "Printable ASCII"
TranspAnalysisUI_lblReadinmode=Read-in mode of the chosen text into the table:
TranspAnalysisUI_link_text=<a>Set own key</a>
TranspAnalysisUI_preview=Preview (deciphered text)
TranspAnalysisUI_read_out_mode_label=Read-out mode of the text in the table\:
TranspAnalysisUI_tooltipParams=The read-in/read-out parameters are given in the form that is required \nby the transposition algorithm wizard in JCrypTool\: from encryption sight. \nThe read-in-direction parameter for the transposition algorithm is the read-out direction \nfrom this analysis and the other way around because this analysis resembles the decryption.
TranspAnalysisUI_view_description=Here you can perform an analysis to decipher a text encrypted by simple column transposition.
