Tab0_Head0=Merkle Signature Scheme

Tab0_Txt0=Using the Merkle Signature Scheme, messages can be signed quantum computer resistant. The signature consists out of two parts, the one time signature (OTS) and the MerkleTree, a binary hashtree. The advantage of MerkleTrees is, that only one Merkle public key is needed for several OTS public keys. This is implemented by summarizing the hash values of the public key using the OTS MerkleTrees into a single hash value at the top of the tree. This value in the root node contains the Merkle public key.
Tab0_Txt2=The Merkle Signature Scheme (MSS) uses as OTS the Winterenitz One Time Signature (WOTS). A free chooseable ammount of WOTS keypairs is created using a random seed. You will find more information in the help menu.
Tab1_Head0=Merkle Signature Scheme
Tab1_Txt0=The MerkleTree illustrated here consists of the hash values of the public keys that are always linked together and hashed h (m1|m2) until only the root node remains.\r\n\r\nSignature:\r\nTo sign a message a One Time Signature is used. The private OTS key is calculated using the private Merkle key. Only one message can be signed with a OTS key pair. To avoid the second usage of a keypair, the key pairs are numbered from 0 to (2^h)-1. This number is called index of the key pair and is stored in the OTS private key. The index is updated after every signature prevents that an OTS key pair is used repeatedly. The Merkle signature is composed of the one time signature, the index of the next unused OTS key pair and the content of the red marked nodes. The red marked nodes are the authentication path.\r\n\r\nVerification:\r\nFor a successful verification of a message the following information is required:\r\n\u2022The public Merkle key\r\n\u2022The Merkle signature (containing OTS signature, index and  authentication path)\r\n\u2022The message\r\n\r\nTo verify a message the OTS public key is calculated from the message and the signature. Together with the index and the authentication path a alternative root node is calculated. If the calculated value matches with the Merkle public key, the verification is successful and the signature is accepted, otherwise the verification will fail.\r\n\r\nLegend:\r\nYellow: Path of the OTS private key to the root node. Red: Nodes of the  authentication path
