Tab0_Head0=eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme	

Tab0_Txt0=The eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS) is a method based on the Merkle Signature Scheme. The difference of to the MSS is the usage of bitmasks and the L-Trees. With this extensions no collisionresistent hashfunction is needed. Only a second preimage resistant hashfunction is needed to guarantee security. Because only a second preimage resistant hashfunction is needed, the signature will get smaller, than using the MSS.
Tab0_Txt2=The eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme uses as OTS the Winterenitz One Time Signature (WOTS). There are the two different variations, WOTS+ or WOTS$. In this plugin we use the WOTS+ scheme. In both varitions there is a freely choosen number of WOTS keypairs generated out of a random seed with the help of a pseudorandom key generator. You will find more information in the help menu.
Tab1_Head0=eXtended MerkleTree
Tab1_Txt0=The eXtended MerkleTree illustrated here consists of the hash values of the public keys that are always linked together, XOR linked with the bitmask Q and afterwards hashed until only the root node remains.\r\n\r\nSignature:\r\nTo sign a message a one time signature is used. The private OTS key is calculated using the private Merkle key. Only one message can be signed with a OTS key pair. To avoid the second usage of a key pair, the key pairs are numbered from 0 to (2^h)-1. This number is called index of the key pair and is stored in the OTS private key. The index is updated after every time a signature is created to prevent that an OTS key pair is used more than once. The XMSS signature consists out of the one time signature, the index of the next unused OTS key pair and the content of the red marked nodes. The red marked nodes are the authentication path.\r\n\r\nVerification:\r\nFor a successful verification of a message the following information is required:\r\n\u2022The public Merkle key\r\n\u2022The Merkle signature (containing OTS signature, index and  authentication path)\r\n\u2022The message\r\n\r\nTo verify a message the OTS public key is calculated from the message and the signature. This OTS public key is used to calculate the root of the corresponding L-Tree. Together with the index and the authentication path a alternative root node is calculated. If the calculated value matches with the XMSS public key, the verification is successful and the signature is accepted, otherwise the verification will fail.\r\n\r\nLegend:\r\nYellow: Path of the OTS private key to the root node. Red: Nodes of the  authentication path
