VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description = Verifiable Secret Sharing is a variation of the simple secret sharing scheme. As with the simple scheme, the secret is split into n shares and distributed to n players,\nso that any number t of the players can reconstruct the secret, while less than t players cannot. However, in the simple scheme one player can covertly sabotage a\nreconstruction by modifying his share. Verifiable secret sharing introduces an improvement to the simple secret sharing scheme by adding a function 'Check' by\nwhich each player can verify the correctness of all shares ('Verifiability'). \n\nWhen the mouse focus is set on a container, a corresponding detailed explanation is displayed in the box below.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_coefficients_left = In this step, the coefficients a\u1D62 [a\u1D62 \u2208 \u2115; 1 \u2264 a\u1D62 < q] for the polynomial P(x) will be set.\n\nOnly coefficients greater than 0 are allowed because otherwise the security of the algorithm may be compromised.\n\nThey can be set either manually, or be generated randomly.\n\na\u2080 is the secret s. \n\nThe remaining coefficients a\u2081 to a_(t-1) are set to 1 by default.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_coefficients_right = The polynomial P(x) is constructed as follows: P(x) = a\u2080 + a\u2081x + a\u2082x\u00B2 + ... + a_(t-1)x^(t-1)\n\nIf all coefficients are set, the polynomial will be displayed,\n\nand it is possible to calculate the commitments and shares.\n\nThe calculation of the shares is independent from the calculation of the commitments. \n\nThe commitments are required for checking the shares.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_commitments_left = In this step, the commitments Y\u2091 for each coefficient a\u2091 are calculated as follows: \n\n Y\u2091 = g ^ a\u2091 mod p \n\nThey are needed in order to check the shares.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_parameters_left = In this step, the following parameters are chosen:\n\n  \u2022 Number of players n [n \u2208 \u2115; n > 1] (mandatory item)\n\n  \u2022 Minimum number of players t required for reconstruction [t \u2208 \u2115; 1 < t \u2264 n] (mandatory item)\n\n  \u2022 Secret s [s \u2208 \u2115] (mandatory item)\n\n    \u2012 Will be randomly generated if nothing is entered.\n\n    \u2012 Is limited to 2,000,000 to keep the calculations within an appropriate time.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_parameters_right = \  \u2022 Safe prime p [p \u2208 \u2119; p > 2s] (mandatory item)\n\n    \u2012 Will be generated automatically.\n\n    \u2012 A safe prime is a prime number of the form 2q + 1 with q prime as well. \n\n  \u2022 Generator g [g \u2208 \u2124_p; order(g)  =  q] (mandatory item)\n\n    \u2012 Will be generated automatically.\n\n  \u2022 q [q \u2208 \u2119] (mandatory item)\n\n    \u2012 It is the biggest prime factor of p-1, while q = (p-1)/2.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_reconstruction_left = In this step, the polynomial and hence the secret will be reconstructed.\n\nFor reconstructing the polynomial, at least t shares need to be selected.\n\nThe reconstruction is done through a Lagrange interpolation:

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_reconstruction_right = \u2022 Keep in mind: \n\n    \u2012 u is the number of chosen players.\n\n    \u2012 x_k and x_l are the players' identification indices.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_reconstruction_right_part2 = The result of the reconstruction is the polynomial P'(x).\nAs the polynomial P(x) had order t-1 and because the Lagrange interpolation is unique,\nwe get P'(x) = P(x). The coefficient a\u2080 of P'(x) represents the secret s.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_shares_left = In this step, the shares for each player i are calculated as follows: \n\nN\u1D62 = P(i) mod q \n\nThe value of i identifies each player, while P(i) is the polynomial. \n\nThe shares are displayed in their original size, which is used for the visualization of the graph, and modulo q.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_shares_right = The check verifies that the share fits the committed polynomial. \n\nThe check of the shares needs to be performed for each player individually. \n\nIf the check has been successful, the share is marked in green. It is marked in red if false. \n\nThe shares can be falsified to show how an altered share modulo q influences the reconstruction. \n\nThe calculation is performed as follows:
