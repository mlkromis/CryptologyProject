JCTCA_Visual_archpic_create_text=If somebody wishes to proof, that a public key corresponds to a private key in his possession, he can get a certificate. To that purpose, he creates a "certificate signing request" (CSR) including his public key and forwards it to a so-called "registration authority" (RA). In addition, he needs to provide some proof of identity, e.g. a copy of a photo ID. The RA checks if the person trying to get a certificate is really the person he claims to be. If that is the case, the RA forwards the CSR to a "certification authority" (CA). The CA creates a certificate out of the CSR, signs this certificate and returns it to the user. The whole of RA, CA and the involved processes are also called a "public-key infrastructure" (PKI).
