	<h1>SHA 3 - ECHO</h1>

	<p>The hash function BLAKE takes a message and salt as input. The salt is either 128 or 256 bits long depending on the hash length
		 and if for some reason it is unneeded or left unspecified, then it takes the all-zero value by default.The output from BLAKE
		is a 32-Byte Hash for BLAKE-224 and BLAKE-256, and is a 64-Byte Hash for BLAKE-384 and BLAKE-512.
        BLAKE is basically 
	</p>

	<b>The following bitlengths are supported:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>224 Bit</li>
		<li>256 Bit</li>
		<li>384 Bit</li>
		<li>512 Bit</li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<p><b>How BLAKE works:</b></p>


	<p>At first the 12 input words are connected with the last 4 chaining words and then the AES rounds follow.
		After that the output is linked to the input per XOR and the first column is used as chaining variable. If the hashlength is between
		128 and 256 the chainingvariable has a length of 512 byte.
		The first bit of the last chaining variable are use as hashvalue.
