#CryptologyProject
##Purpose
This project focuses on developing SHA3 candidates plug-ins for Jcryptool Software. 

Jcryptool Software is a platform mainly focusing on collecting various encrytion algorithms. Developers can add functions to this platform by developing plug-ins for the software. More information on Jcryptool can found in https://github.com/jcryptool/core/wiki.

About SHA3 and SHA3 candidates, more information can be found in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3 and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_hash_function_competition.
The plug-ins we develop can be categorized into 2 branches, implementation and visualization plug-ins. The implementation plug-ins can be integrated into Jcryptool software so that users can use this software to encrypt their messages by using SHA3 candidates, as well as compare the encrypted messages each SHA3 candidates generate. The visualization plug-ins can be integrated into Jcryptool software so that users can use this plug-in to learn how the algorithms of encryption candidates work so that the encryption process won't be a black box.

##How to deploy the plug-ins on your computer
This GitHub Repository holds the files for our additions to the JCrypTool Application. In here we have:
Blake Algorithm (Dan Finn Branch)
Groestl Algorithm (Zixun Yuan Branch)
Keccak Algorithm (Maria Kromis Branch)
New SHA-3 Candidates Dialog Box (Maria Kromis Branch)
Blake-224 Visualization (Weichao Zhou Branch)

To download JCrypTool, follow the instructions located here:

##Attention: 
The plug-ins won't be integrated into the released version of Jcryptool software in the website above until they are approved by the Jcryptool Project leaders Dominik Schadow(schadow@gmail.com)and Prof. Bernhard Esslinger(esslinger@fb5.uni-siegen.de). So currently users can only integrate the plug-ins into Jcryptool in the same way as developers do. The general guidline of integrate plug-ins into Jcryptool is here https://github.com/jcryptool/core/wiki. There are also additional steps to add specific plug-ins. The instructions on those additional steps are provided in our seperate branches.
We are currently working on packaging all of these files into plugins to be easily instered into the JCrypTool Application.
